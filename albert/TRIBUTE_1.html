<li> Albert Einstien was a German-born theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics (alongside quantum mechanics).</li>
<li> He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect", a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory.</li>

<h1 id="id1"> A BFIEF INFO ABOUT HIS LIFE </h1>
<img class="im1" alt="phy" src="alb_img4.JPG" style="width:400px;height:400px;">
<ul class="ulall">

<li>Albert Einstein was born in Ulm, in the Kingdom of Württemberg in the German Empire, on 14 March 1879. His parents were Hermann Einstein, a salesman and engineer, and Pauline Koch.</li>
<li>Einstein always excelled at math and physics from a young age, reaching a mathematical level years ahead of his peers. The 12-year-old Einstein taught himself algebra and Euclidean geometry over a single summer. Einstein also independently discovered his own original proof of the Pythagorean theorem at age 12.</li>
<li>Although initially treated with skepticism from many in the scientific community, Einstein's works gradually came to be recognised as significant advancements.</li>

<h1 class="abc"> HIS ACADEMIC CAREER </h1>
<img class="mess" alt="phy" src="alb_img2.JPG" style="width:600px;height:600px;" >
<ul class="ulall" >
<li> By 1908, he was recognized as a leading scientist and was appointed lecturer at the University of Bern. The following year, after he gave a lecture on electrodynamics and the relativity principle at the University of Zurich, Alfred Kleiner recommended him to the faculty for a newly created professorship in theoretical physics. Einstein was appointed associate professor in 1909.</li>
<li> Einstein became a full professor at the German Charles-Ferdinand University in Prague in April 1911, accepting Austrian citizenship in the Austro-Hungarian Empire to do so. During his Prague stay, he wrote 11 scientific works, five of them on radiation mathematics and on the quantum theory of solids.</li> 
<li> In July 1912, he returned to his alma mater in Zürich. From 1912 until 1914, he was a professor of theoretical physics at the ETH Zurich, where he taught analytical mechanics and thermodynamics. He also studied continuum mechanics, the molecular theory of heat, and the problem of gravitation, on which he worked with mathematician and friend Marcel Grossmann. </li>
<li> Einstein's affiliation with the Institute for Advanced Study would last until his death in 1955. He was one of the four first selected (two of the others being John von Neumann and Kurt Gödel) at the new Institute, where he soon developed a close friendship with Gödel. The two would take long walks together discussing their work. Bruria Kaufman, his assistant, later became a physicist. </li>

<img class="acb" alt="phy" src="alb_img3.JPG" style="width:550px;height:550px;padx=500px" >
<ul class="ulall" >
<li> Throughout his life, Einstein published hundreds of books and articles. He published more than 300 scientific papers and 150 non-scientific ones. On 5 December 2014, universities and archives announced the release of Einstein's papers, comprising more than 30,000 unique documents.</li> 
<li> Some of his most important works include: 
	<ul>
	<li>The Photoelectric Effect- which resolved an unsolved puzzle by suggesting that energy is exchanged only in discrete amounts (quanta). This idea was pivotal to the early development of quantum theory. </li>
	<li>The Brownian Motion- which explained empirical evidence for the atomic theory, supporting the application of statistical physics.</li>
	<li>Special Relativity- which reconciled Maxwell's equations for electricity and magnetism with the laws of mechanics by introducing changes to mechanics, resulting from analysis based on empirical evidence that the speed of light is independent of the motion of the observer.</li>
	<li>Matter-Energy Equivalence- which is based on the equivalence of matter and energy, E = mc^2 (and by implication, the ability of gravity to "bend" light), the existence of "rest energy", and the basis of nuclear energy.</li>
	</ul>

<h1 class="abc"> A LIST OF HIS ACHIEVEMENTS </h1>
<ol>
	<li>On November 12, 1913, Einstein was granted full membership in the Prussian Academy of Sciences.</li>
	<li>On November 12, 1919, the University of Rostock awarded an honorary doctorate of medicine (Dr. med. h.c.) to Einstein, on the occasion of its 500th anniversary and following a suggestion by Moritz Schlick. This is the only honorary doctorate he received from a German university.</li>
	<li>In 1922 Albert Einstein was awarded the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics, "for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect". This refers to his 1905 paper on the photoelectric effect, "On a Heuristic Viewpoint Concerning the Production and Transformation of Light", which was well supported by the experimental evidence by that time. The presentation speech began by mentioning "his theory of relativity [which had] been the subject of lively debate in philosophical circles [and] also has astrophysical implications which are being rigorously examined at the present time".</li>
	<li>In 1925 the Royal Society awarded Einstein the Copley Medal.</li>
	<li>In 1926, he was awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society. </li>
	<li>In 1929, Max Planck presented Einstein with the Max Planck medal of the German Physical Society in Berlin, for extraordinary achievements in theoretical physics.</li>
	</li>
	<li>In 1931, he received the Prix Jules Janssen, In 1934 Einstein gave the Josiah Willard Gibbs lecture.</li>
	<li>In 1936, Einstein was awarded the Franklin Institute's Franklin Medal for his extensive work on relativity and the photo-electric effect.</li>
</ol>
<h1 class="abc"> A LIST OF  AWARDS NAMED AFTER EINSTIEN </h1>
<ol>
	<li>The Albert Einstein Award (sometimes called the Albert Einstein Medal because it is accompanied with a gold medal) is an award in theoretical physics, established to recognize high achievement in the natural sciences. It was endowed by the Lewis and Rosa Strauss Memorial Fund in honor of Albert Einstein's 70th birthday. It was first awarded in 1951 and included a prize money of $15,000, which was later reduced to $5,000. The winner is selected by a committee (the first of which consisted of Einstein, Oppenheimer, von Neumann and Weyl) of the Institute for Advanced Study, which administers the award.</li>
	<li>The Albert Einstein Medal is an award presented by the Albert Einstein Society in Bern, Switzerland. First given in 1979, the award is presented to people who have "rendered outstanding services" in connection with Einstein.</li>
	<li>The Albert Einstein Peace Prize is given yearly by the Chicago, Illinois-based Albert Einstein Peace Prize Foundation. Winners of the prize receive $50,000.</li>
